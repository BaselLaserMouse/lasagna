Lasagna Changelog


What is Lasagna?
Lasagna is a Python-based image viewer for 3-D anatomy datasets. It was inspired by the "slicing viewer",
VV (https://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/rio/vv). Lasagna was originally written in 2015/2016 at the Mrsic-Flogel

Very extensive changes have been made to the dev branch and many things currently don't start. 
First goal is to get everything running again. Some things are partially refactored, like tree, 
and so aren't working. The first goal is to get everything running and then we can go back and 
refactor. To that end I will add a tag to 7c1d0a7b4437864d3d6cb9dd6518901dad627113 on GitHub. 
This is tagged as refactorBreakPoint01 This is the last commit with partially refactored stuff. 
I will revert stuff that's not working yet in order to get it working. We can later come back 
to this commit and use it as the basis for refactoring.

Most modules now load. All this commit does is change module load paths. Mainly:
"import lasagna_helperFunctions as lasHelp" to "import lasagna.utils.preferences as lasPref"
"from lasagna_plugin import lasagna_plugin" to "from lasagna.plugins.lasagna_plugin import LasagnaPlugin"

Reverts partial refactoring of the tree class used for plotting neurite trees and also for the ARA tree view. 
TODO: in future refactor tree. See Issue #192.
