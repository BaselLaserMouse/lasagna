<a id="lasagna---python-volume-visualiser-for-3-d-data" class="anchor" href="#lasagna---python-volume-visualiser-for-3-d-data" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage Instructions</h1>



<h2>
<a id="concept" class="anchor" href="#concept" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Starting</h2>
<p>See <a href="installation.html">the installation guide</a> for getting started. 
To get a feel for the viewer with some demo, data start Lasagna with the <tt>-D</tt> flag.
</p>


<h2>
<a id="concept" class="anchor" href="#concept" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Loading data</h2>
<p>Lasagna currently accepts only single-channel 3D data that can be loaded completely into RAM. 
Data may be in the form of TIFF stacks or MHD files. Go to <tt>File > Load ingredient</tt> and select <tt>New base stack</tt>. 
A "base stack" is the first 3D image stack to be loaded. All other data, such as overlaid image stacks or points, are
added on top of this base stack. Whenever a new base stack is loaded, any other plotted or loaded data are discarded.
</p>

<h2>
<a id="concept" class="anchor" href="#concept" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Navigating 3D data</h2>
<p>Once a base stack is loaded you may navigate it with the mouse. When the mouse is moved over one 2D view, 
a set of cross-hairs appear.  The other two axes show two orthogonal slices taken at the planes of the 
X and Y cross-hairs. As the cross-hairs are moved across the image, the slices shown in the other two plots 
update automatically. Zooming is performed with ctrl+mousewheel and panning by clicking and dragging the current view. 
The other views automatically follow. If you lose the sample due to zooming out too much, hit the reset 
(green circular arrow) button in the toolbar</p>

<p>You can change the intensity range of the image by moving the sliders on the histogram. Note that the
intensity range in the histogram is currently that of the base stack only. This will be fixed and much
greater control over the plotted data will provided soon.</p>

<h2>
<a id="concept" class="anchor" href="#concept" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overlaying data</h2>
<p>
With a base stack loaded, you may overlay a second volume to compare the two. 
The overlaid volume <i>must have the same size</i> as the base volume upon which you wish to overlay it. Once 
an overlay is loaded, the first loaded layer turns red and the new layer is shown in green. 
Overlapping regions are yellow. In this way Lasagna makes it easy to examine the accuracy of 3D image registration.
To remove the overay, use the Remove Overlay button in the toolbar.
</p>

<h2>
<a id="concept" class="anchor" href="#concept" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Using plugins</h2>
<p>
Plugins are independent pieces of Python code that modify the behavior or functionality of Lasagna. For example,
the volume overlay described above is handled by a special core plugin that runs all the  time. Most plugins, 
however, must be started as needed by the user. Plugins are started by selecting them from the plugin menu. 
Once started, a tick sybol appears next to the plugin's entry in the menu. Plugins can be stopped by unchecking 
the menu or, where appropriate, closing the plugin's window. Some plugins, such as
the Allen Reference Atlas explorer are shut automatically if the user attempts to load a new data set.</p>


<h2>
<a id="concept" class="anchor" href="#concept" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Preferences</h2>

<p>
When Lasagna is first loaded it creates a <tt>.lasagna</tt> hidden directory in your home directory. This contains a 
plain text configuration file called <tt>lasagna_prefs.yml</tt>. The contents of this file are fairly self-explanatory 
and you may edit it. Parameters from the file can be loaded as needed during run time. So in some cases your 
changes will take effect right away. 
</p>

<p>
Users wishing to add new preferences should look at the <tt>lasagna_helperFunctions</tt> module and 
see <tt>lasagna.showFileLoadDialog()</tt> for an example of how preferences are read and written. 
Some basic Python knowledge is needed to do this.
