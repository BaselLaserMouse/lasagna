Very large data sets will need to be downsampled. lasagna allows the user to visualise data as three linked 2-D views. The views are linked such that they all zoom and pan together. Moving the mouse cursor in one view controls which slice (of the 3-D volume) is displayed in the other two views. The viewer is *only a prototype* but it works well.\r\n\r\n## Current features\r\n* Interactive exploration of one 3D volume. \r\n* Overlay of a second volume onto the first. Useful for assessing the degree of alignment between two 3D samples. \r\n* Loading of either TIFF stacks or MHD files, so can work well with [Elastix](http://elastix.isi.uu.nl/). \r\n* Interactive exploration of the ARA brain areas through a simple plugin.\r\n* A simple plugin system: Python scripts with a particular format located in a particular directory are made accessible via a \"Plugins\" menu and can modify the behavior of lasagna by calling existing methods or modifying those methods via hooks. \r\n* The zoom can be reset via a button and the scale modified by sliders on top of an image intensity histogram.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Critical upcoming features ##\r\nFor the program to be useful, we must implement the following features:\r\n\r\n* Overlaying extracted data (e.g. cell locations, cell densities, or traced neurons) over the image stacks. \r\n* An overhauled axis class to allow for arbitrary data to be easily overlaid.\r\n* Interactive exploration of Allen Reference Atlas brain areas in relation to registered brain. e.g. displaying current brain by mousing over and highlighting areas from a list.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
